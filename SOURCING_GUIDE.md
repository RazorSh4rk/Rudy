# BOM

__IMPORTANT__ Rudy was designed with aliexpress in mind. This means that a lot of unevenness, slop, and general China quality is already factored into the printed parts. The frame uses flextures to guarantee squareness, even if the metal parts are bent. Feel free to go for the cheapest listings you can find, or even print parts of the frame yourself (2020 beams are prime candidate for this).

# Frame

| 2020 length | pieces | for what |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 150mm | 6 | top and bottom squares |
| 150mm | 2 | bed carriage | 
| pick a length | 4 | frame Z |

# Z

### for all configs: 

The length of the Z rails is going to be the length of your Z 2020 extrusions _MINUS 50mm_, so if you picked 200mm, then your rails are 150mm, which will give you about 120mm travel.

### Extruder notes

If you use bowden, just use whatever extruder you like, a voron m4 or a bmg clone is nice and cheap.

If you want to go bowden, warhead has support for sailfin, and will eventually have support for sherpa micro, so pick either of those (sailfin can be built from a $5 bmg kit)
